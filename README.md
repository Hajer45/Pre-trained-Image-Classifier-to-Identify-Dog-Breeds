# Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

This project uses a pre-trained deep learning model to identify dog breeds from images. The classifier can analyze images and determine both whether the image contains a dog and, if so, estimate the breed of the dog.

## Features

- Classify images of dogs into their respective breeds
- Detect whether an image contains a dog
- Uses state-of-the-art pre-trained neural networks
- Support for multiple image formats
- Detailed classification statistics and results

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Anaconda or Miniconda
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds.git

```

2. Create a new conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n dogbreed python=3.8
```

3. Activate the conda environment:
```bash
conda activate dogbreed
```

4. Install required packages:
